	INTRODUCTION
	
	A plugin module for jQuery for nice looking Tooltips instead of the traditional dull ones
	
	FEATURES
	
	* Easy to setup
	* No additional css markup needed
	* Tested on Firefox, Chrome and IE 9
	* No need to write long javascript routines, just add it between <head></head> tags.
		<script type="text/javascript" src="path to g-Tooltips.js" />
	* Simply invoke the plugin in your document onLoad event and it will take care of everything
		$(document).ready(function() {
			$('your element/s here').forgeTooltips();
		});
	* Don't like default background color and you want to change the opacity as well as orientation? Not an issue
		$(document).ready(function() {
			var options = { orientation:'top', backgroundColor:'#007543', opacity:0.8  };
			$('your element/s here').forgeTooltips(options);
		});
		* Please be advised left orientation is not working right now but top, bottom and right positioning works fine, that will be covered in the next release
	* Multiple elements support in single call.
		$('body button[title],body input[title],body a[title]').forgeTooltips(options);
		Easy as it looks!
